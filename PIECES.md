## PUBLISHED

### I Used to Think I Had a Discipline Problem
- **Synopsis:** ADHD reframe essay. Ideas evaporating → shame loop → productivity systems reinforcing failure → ride bag as proof the issue was friction not discipline → AI meeting me where I was → low-friction inbox + AI processing → nervous system relief → ADHD as design constraint not flaw → cognitive research validates lived experience → AI as mirror (reinforce or challenge) → designing WITH the mind, not against it.
- **File:** `src/content/essays/2026-02-20-ai-didnt-replace-my-thinking.md`
- **Added:** 2026-02-20
- **Tags:** ADHD, cognition, AI, systems-design, shame, flow, personal-essay
- **Thesis:** This is NOT a productivity essay. It is about misdiagnosing yourself as undisciplined when the real issue is friction between cognition and systems.
- **Strong lines (preserve):** "I wasn't just losing ideas. I was collecting evidence against myself." / "That moment wasn't confusion. It was shame." / "I stopped treating myself like a failed implementation." / "It was a shame interruption." / Ending: designing with my mind.
- **Status note:** Flagship piece — establishes voice and thematic direction for NorthWoods Sentinel. Four drafts deep. Final polish complete. Ready for Rob's approval to publish.
- **Published:** 2026-02-20
- **Notes:** Four drafts (original → Mirror → ride bag integration → final polish). Flagship piece — establishes voice and thematic direction.

- **Published:** 2026-02-16

### The Real Problem With AI Assistants Isn't Intelligence
- **Synopsis:** AI assistants drift out of the correct interaction mode more often than they fail at accuracy. That misalignment — not capability — is the real design problem.

- **Published:** 2026-02-18

### What SOC Analysts Notice and Nobody Captures
- **Synopsis:** Organizations pay for analyst intuition then design systems that discard it. The real SOC problem isn't tooling — it's that institutional knowledge walks out the door every shift change.
