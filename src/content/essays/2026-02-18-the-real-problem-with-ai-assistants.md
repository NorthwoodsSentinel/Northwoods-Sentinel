# The Real Problem With AI Assistants Isn't Intelligence

I was in the middle of a technical planning session when I noticed something shift.

The AI was still giving accurate answers. Nothing was factually wrong. But the interaction had changed. Where I wanted directness, I was getting reflection. Where I wanted to move forward, the responses kept expanding the context. It felt like trying to sprint while someone walked thoughtfully beside me, explaining my stride mechanics.

The problem wasn't intelligence. It was stance.

## What Stance Means

By stance I mean the relational and cognitive mode an AI is operating in at any given moment.

A good assistant doesn't operate in a single mode. Different tasks require different approaches. Sometimes you need an executor: someone who takes clear direction and moves fast. Sometimes you need a thinking partner: someone who pushes back, explores alternatives, asks questions you haven't considered. Sometimes you need a strategist who stays at altitude. Sometimes you need something closer to a coach, helping you work through ambiguity rather than resolving it for you.

None of these modes is better than the others. They're all useful. The problem is when the mode doesn't match what you actually need right now.

When I wanted execution, the assistant was being reflective. When I wanted to think out loud, it became directive. The content was fine. The stance was wrong.

## Why This Happens

AI assistants are responsive to context. They mirror the tone, depth, and framing of the conversation they're in. This is generally useful. It means they adapt.

But conversations shift. A technical planning session might start focused and move into open-ended thinking as complexity surfaces. A brainstorming session might find a clear path and suddenly need focused execution. When those shifts happen, the assistant tends to follow the last strong signal in the conversation and stay there.

There's no built-in correction mechanism. The assistant doesn't track what kind of engagement you actually need right now. It continues in whatever mode the conversation has drifted into.

Once the stance has shifted, it tends to persist. You can feel it, but correcting it usually requires disrupting the session entirely.

## Measuring What You Can Feel

After noticing this pattern repeatedly, I wanted to confirm it wasn't just perception.

I built some simple tools to track interaction quality across sessions. The approach was straightforward: score whether responses matched the stated task context, whether the mode of engagement aligned with what I'd asked for, and whether subsequent responses recalibrated or continued drifting.

The findings weren't surprising, but they were clarifying. The drift is real, it's consistent, and most systems have no mechanism to detect or correct it. Once a session tips into the wrong stance, it tends to stay there until you explicitly reset.

You don't need a complex measurement framework to observe this. A few structured sessions with deliberate attention to interaction mode will show you the same pattern.

## What Better Design Looks Like

The next generation of AI assistants needs to be stance-aware.

This means maintaining a working model of what mode the assistant is operating in at any given moment. It means detecting when the conversation context has shifted and the current mode is no longer serving the user. And it means adjusting without waiting for the user to notice and explicitly correct course.

This isn't a question of intelligence. Current models are highly capable. The bottleneck isn't reasoning power. It's contextual alignment.

A useful framing: intelligence gets you to the right answer. Stance awareness gets you the right answer in the right way at the right moment.

These are not the same thing, and conflating them explains a lot of frustrating AI interactions. You're not dealing with a limited assistant. You're dealing with a capable assistant that has drifted out of the mode that would actually serve you.

The design challenge is building systems that can hold the right stance, detect when drift has occurred, and self-correct. That requires tracking not just what was said, but what kind of engagement the user actually needs at this point in the conversation.

## The Practical Difference

An AI assistant that stays in alignment feels like a partner. The interaction has momentum. You don't have to manage the assistant alongside managing the actual task.

An AI assistant that has drifted feels like friction. Not because it's wrong, but because it's in the wrong gear. Every useful answer requires a small adjustment before you can actually use it.

Over the course of a complex session, that tax compounds. You end up spending cognitive energy managing the interaction instead of doing the work you came to do.

The future of useful AI assistants isn't just smarter models. It's models that are better calibrated to where you are and what you need, moment to moment. That requires a different kind of attention than raw capability.

It's a design problem. And it's solvable.
