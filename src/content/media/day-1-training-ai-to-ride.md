## Day 1 — Teaching an AI to Ride With Me

**From 4/10 to 9/10 in 24 hours.**

---

### Context

Yesterday was Day 0.

First attempts were rough.

Jarring cuts. Wrong orientation. No corner feel.

AI didn't understand motion continuity yet.

#### Day 0 Clip

**File:** `day1_edit.mp4` (143MB, 15s)
**Rating:** 4/10

> *Video hosting in progress - YouTube embed will be added*

**What went wrong:**
- Static starts
- Wrong energy
- No corner feel
- Doesn't feel like riding

No ego defense. This was bad.

---

### What Changed

Constraints added:
- Rotation detection fixed
- No static shots
- Bike visible at all times
- Cuts occur after lean stabilizes
- Velocity continuity across transitions
- 15-second structure respected

#### Day 1 Clip

**File:** `coast_brake_edit_15s.mp4` (77MB, 15s)
**Rating:** 9/10

> *Video hosting in progress - YouTube embed will be added*

Better. Corners feel coherent. Velocity matches. This feels like riding.

### Training Notes

**The system:**
- Rating scale: 1–10
- Under 7 = diagnose
- 7+ = store pattern
- No verbose analysis
- Execution > storytelling

**Progression:**
- Initial: 4/10 (upside down, no motion)
- Refined: 6/10 (speed jumps)
- Matched: 7/10 (cuts during corrections)
- **Coast brake: 9/10** (smooth flow maintained)

**What I'm teaching it:**
- Directional coherence
- Lean stabilization timing
- Velocity matching
- Motion continuity

---

### Why This Matters

This isn't about AI replacing editors.

This is about:
- **AI as apprenticeship** — It learns my style through iteration
- **Clear constraint definition** — I specify rules once
- **Autonomous execution** — System applies consistently
- **Compounding learning** — Gets better daily

**Time saved per edit:**
- Manual edit: 45-90 minutes
- With trained system: 2 minutes (watch + rate)

That's the leverage.

---

### What's Next

Continue daily training:
- Drop footage
- Rate output
- Store learning
- Iterate

Goal: Consistent 8+ ratings with minimal prompting.

Eventually: Ride → upload → wake up → usable cut waiting.

That's when this becomes a real force multiplier.

*This is Day 1 of documenting the training process. More updates as the system improves.*
