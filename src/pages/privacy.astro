      <p>Northwoods Sentinel is a personal website owned and operated by Robert Chuvala. This policy explains what information is collected when you visit this site and how it is used.</p>

      <h2>What We Collect</h2>
      <p>When you visit Northwoods Sentinel, the following information may be collected automatically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Page views and navigation</strong> — which pages you visit and how you move through the site</li>

        <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> — country or region, derived from your IP address</li>

      <p>This site does not collect your name, email address, or any information that directly identifies you. There are no user accounts, contact forms, or login systems.</p>

      <h2>How We Use It</h2>
      <p>Analytics data is used to understand how the site is being read — which essays get traffic, where readers come from, and how the site performs. This helps improve the content and experience.</p>
      <p>No data is sold. No data is shared with advertisers. No data is used for behavioral targeting or profiling.</p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>This site uses cookies placed by Google Analytics to track visits across sessions. These are analytics cookies, not advertising cookies.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>_ga</code> — distinguishes unique users, expires after 2 years</li>
        <li><code>_ga_[ID]</code> — stores and counts pageviews, expires after 2 years</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can opt out of analytics tracking at any time using the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On</a>.</p>

      <p>No other third-party services currently collect data from visitors to this site.</p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Google Analytics retains event-level data for 14 months by default. Aggregated reporting data may be retained longer. You can request deletion of data associated with your visits using the opt-out tool above.</p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
